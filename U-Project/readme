use a JavaScript library or a service that provides a ready-made chat widget. This widget will handle the user's input, display the bot's responses, and manage the conversational state.
Choose a Bot Service: Select a platform like Dialogflow,
Create the Bot Logic: In your chosen service, define the bot's conversation flow. For the "PersonalizedU" website, your bot should be able to:

Greet the user.

Explain what the website does.

Direct users to the assessment ("open-assessment").

Answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) like "What are the features?" or "How does the AI work?".

Integrate the Chat Widget: This is the key step.

Most bot services provide a small JavaScript snippet to embed on your website. This snippet creates the chat button and handles the communication between your user's browser and the bot's back-end.

You'll add this <script> tag right before the closing </body> tag, similar to how the existing scripts are placed.
